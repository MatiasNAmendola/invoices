INVOICES
--------

This application is designed as a simple and effective invoice management
system. It uses PHP, MySQL with database transactions, theming, and HTML-to-PDF 
conversions (wkhtmltopdf) to manipulate and present invoices to the user. 


THEMES

Build HTML themes with CSS styles incorporated into one file; upload these files
to the 'themes' directory and set the filename as the default theme under
Settings. In building these themes use the following replacement tokens to
incorporate invoice data:

invoice.id, invoice.status, invoice.total, invoice.pdf, invoice.created, 
invoice.modified, invoice.client_first_name, invoice.client_last_name, 
invoice.client_email, invoice.project, invoice.company, invoice.description, 
invoice.entries, invoice.discounts, invoice.payments, invoice.url, 
entry_table (HTML table of time entries), payment_table (HTML table of payments)

Use double brackets to enclose the token. For example, the proper format for 
inserting the link to the invoice would be:

[[invoice.url]]


SETTINGS

CACHE

All PDF files created by 'wkhtmltopdf' are stored in the cache folder
